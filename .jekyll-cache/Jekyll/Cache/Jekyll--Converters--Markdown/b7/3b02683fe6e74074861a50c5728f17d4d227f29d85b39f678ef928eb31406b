<h1 id="homework">Homework</h1>

<p>The <a href="http://github.com/homework">homework</a> project built a router based on user studies ‚Äòin the wild‚Äô.
The homework router uses OpenVSwitch and NOX to provide novel interaction methods for home routers.</p>

<p>My contribution to the project was a notification system. Source code for the notification system is
available in Github in two projects, a Google <a href="http://github.com/homework/homework-notify">App Engine</a> app
and a <a href="http://github.com/homework/homework-notify-server">server</a> running on the router.</p>

<h1 id="phd-notification-system">PhD Notification system</h1>

<p>The router I built for my PhD is based on the Homework Router. The App Engine App required additional
features to support the features I created for my PhD. The source code for this is <a href="http://github.com/rjspencer1989/homework-notify">forked</a>
from the original.</p>

<h1 id="network-manager">Network Manager</h1>

<p><a href="http://github.com/rjspencer1989/NetworkManagerApp">Network Manager</a> is a set of router scripts and an Android application		
which displays network status information. It is possible to see how much bandwidth each device on the network		
is using, and what websites were visited on each device. It was developed for my BSc dissertation.</p>
