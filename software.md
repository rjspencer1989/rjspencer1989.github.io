# Homework
The [homework](http://github.com/homework) project built a router based on user studies 'in the wild'.
The homework router uses OpenVSwitch and NOX to provide novel interaction methods for home routers.

My contribution to the project was a notification system. Up-to-date source code for the notification system is
available in [Github](http://github.com/rjspencer1989/homework-notify)

# Network Manager
[Network Manager](http://github.com/rjspencer1989/NetworkManagerApp) is a set of router scripts and an Android application
which displays network status information. It is possible to see how much bandwidth each device on the network
is using, and what websites were visited on each device. It was developed for my BSc dissertation.
