# Homework
The [homework](http://github.com/homework) project built a router based on user studies 'in the wild'.
The homework router uses OpenVSwitch and NOX to provide novel interaction methods for home routers.

My contribution to the project was a notification system. Up-to-date source code for the notification system is
available in [Github](http://github.com/rjspencer1989/homework-notify)
